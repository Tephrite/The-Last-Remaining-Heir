Game Introduction
The game that I have developed is titled “The Last Remaining Heir” which is an escape room based around the descendants of Jesus Christ. The story of the game is based around the book by Dan Brown in his best seller The Da Vinci Code. Since the game falls under the escape room genre, the objective of the game is to follow the story to completion in order to escape the room you’re locked in. If you do not manage to do so, the Vatican will break into the room resulting in you losing the game.

This game was meant to be based in VR primarily the HTC Vive however there were technical issues that occurred with gaining access to working a VR setup therefore I decided to turn the game into a regular first person game. I feel like this kind of game would work best if the person is being immersed by the world so I felt this was the next best thing. I still kept some aspects of the game as they would be in VR such as picking up things which I will go into below.

Rules and Gameplay
There aren’t any rules to the game, you may pick up or move anything however there is only one way to win the game and that is by finding the code to unlock the door. If the code is input incorrectly 3 times then the room will go into shut down mode, resulting in the game ending.

 As mentioned earlier, you are breaking in to the Priory of Sion to prove the long lost blood line of Jesus Christ.

 

You spawn in with a note on the table saying that a researcher has found a blood sample of the long lost blood line of Jesus Christ but he is keeping it from the Vatican who are hunting him down. It is hidden somewhere in this room. The door you entered has been locked behind you and the code to the door is written on the compartment where the blood sample rests. The key lies in the word of God


There is a bible and inside the bible is a key to a chest that is also somewhere in the room.

 

Inside the chest is a piece of paper with the writing (“Hitherto shalt thous come, but no further.” – Job 38:11)



The numbers 38:11 refers to the bookshelf number (38) and the book on that shelf (11). Pulling this book opens a door
 

There is a shrine with the sample on display. There is also a note left by the researcher saying “Keep it secret, keep it safe”. On the wall behind the book are the numbers 3334.


Inputting this code into the keypad on will open the door to the end of the game
